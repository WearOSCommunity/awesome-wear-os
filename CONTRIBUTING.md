```

```

### Examples

> [!TIP]
> For open source projects, always link both the store listing and source code repository.

Closed source paid app:

```markdown
- [Amazing Watch Face](https://play.google.com/...) `ðŸ”’`
```

Open source free app:

```markdown
- [Cool Timer](https://play.google.com/...) ([source code](https://github.com/...)) `ðŸ”“`
```

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure all links are permanent and point to Google Play or a GitHub release (or similar), not to specific versions or temporary locations.

### Category Structure

Apps should be placed in appropriate categories and subcategories:

```markdown
### Category Name

#### Free

- [Free App 1](link) `emoji`
- [Free App 2](link) `emoji`

<details open>
<summary>ðŸª™ Apps with in app purchases</summary>

<!-- Add your app here if it has IAPs -->
</details>

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’° Paid apps</summary>

<!-- Add your app here if it's paid -->

```

> [!NOTE]
> The free apps will come first. App's with in app purchases and that are paid will come after and will be collapsible so that users can see app's that align with their pricing preference.
